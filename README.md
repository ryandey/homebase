# Welcome to Homebase
Homebase is what I consider my personal hub. It's a display of my identity, what I've accomplished, and the work I've created.

## The Stack
I wanted to keep Homebase as simple but iterable as possible. Of course, I had to use the technology that I'm most familiar with for my portfolio, so I chose React. The rest is easy:
* TypeScript
* Vite.js
* React
* Tailwind CSS
* Shadcn/ui

In opposition to my statement about the stuff I'm most familiar with, I decided to utilize TypeScript for this project because it was a good, easy way to ease into learning it. This is the first major project I've used TypeScript in its entirety for, so I wanted to start out simple.

## Run it Yourself
Of course, in the spirit of this project being open-source and public on GitHub, here's the installation instructions after cloning the repository:

First, install the dependencies:
```
yarn
```

Then run the app:
```
yarn run dev
```

I love simplicity. That's all I have to say about this project for now, so please go check it out! Thank you for reading!
